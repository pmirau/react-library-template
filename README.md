# Test React Package

## Goal

This repository provides a boilerplate for developing react libraries.

It uses the following technologies
- Webpack for bundling
- Babel for transpiling
- Jest for testing
- NextJS as React host framework
- `mini-css-extract-plugin` as 'css bundler'
- Support for Typescript (webpack config defaults to typescript)

## Structure

```
|-- host/               <- provides a react server for live-testing the library
|-- __tests__/
|-- src/                <- recommended libary structure
    |-- __example__/    <- provide example components, which can be used during development
        |-- index.ts    <- always use index.ts files as interfaces for the library consumer
    |-- .../
    |-- index.ts        <- library interface
|-- dist/
|-- ...    
```

To sum up, there should be two possible entrypoints for the library consumer:
1. All modules used in production should only be accessible via `src/index.ts`
2. In some cases example-components for showcasing can be accessible via `src/__example__/index.ts`  
   (Though they are initially intended for usage during library development/showcasing)

## Usage

### Library boilerplate (this package)

#### Initialize

Before managing npm-packages on the `npm.pkg.github.com`-registry on a machine,
[authenticate](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages)
to GitHub Packages first.

1. Clone this repository
2. Delete `.git` to remove git dependencies
3. Rename `README.md` to `README_BUILD.md` (To use `README.md` for the library)
4. Update `package.json` fields
5. Init a new repository (TODO: Document steps)
    1. Create a new, empty repository on GitHub
    2. Follow the "Quick setup" steps
        1. `git init`
        2. `git add .`
        3. `git commit -m "build: init repository"`
        4. `git remote add origin <repository-url>`
        5. `git push -u origin master`

#### Publish package

Use the [Publishing a package using publishConfig in the package.json file](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#publishing-a-package-using-publishconfig-in-the-packagejson-file)
guide.

Hint: Use `files` in `package.json` to define the files, which should be published.

Hint: use `npm pack` or `npm publish --dry-run` to test the output.

#### Update package

To update, use '[npm version](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-version)'.

#### Install package in consumer

Use the [Installing a package](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#installing-a-package)
guide.

#### package.json scripts

- `dev:test`: develop library in BDD
- `dev:live`: start library to live-develop via consumption in host via `yarn link`
- `test:jest`: run a jest test
- `test:ts`: run tsc without emitting, to type-check the code
- `build:js`: compile ts to js without declaration files
- `build:tsd`: transpile ts declarations only
- `build`: build library

### Development

Use _Behavior Driven Development_ during development (`yarn dev`)

### Host

To live test the library, you can use following options:

#### Yarn Link

1. Execute `yarn link` in the root directory
2. Execute the provided command (`yarn link <package>`) in `host/`

Alternative:

1. Run `yarn add link:/path/to/local/folder` in `host/`

To enable autocompletion, mark the library in `host/node_modules` as `Cancel exclusion`
(see https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WEB-16713#focus=streamItem-27-3055019-0-0)

#### Symlink

Or symlink src/ into the example-framework to retain the initial NextJS compilation speed:  
`ln -s <src>/ <symlinked-folder-name>`  
But remember to design the library interface abstract, so that nothing changes for the imports
but the import-path (by exporting all components etc. via `src/index.ts`)

#### Self-host

_Not implemented!_

Also consider to spin up a custom React server via webpack-dev-server.

for more info.

#### Alternatives
- CRA
- Storybook
- React Styleguidist (+ Emotion)

## Git

### Commit Messages

- Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification
- Follow [Angular types](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#type)
    - additionally
        - devenv: Changes that affect the development environment. So everything regarding the React
          server setup for live-'testing' or viewing the library

### Branch names

`<type>--<description>`

Start the description with a verb if possible.

## Notes

### `react` as dev-& peer-dependency

Also add `react` as a dev-dependency alongside the peer-dependency in the library.
Because otherwise NextJS throws the error `Module not found: Can't resolve 'react'`

### Define dependencies as externals

Define dependencies, which should be added while consuming the library (ie. not bundled with
main.js) in webpack-externals.

## Library Guidelines

### CSS

In the library you can use css-modules. CSS will be built into a separate file, which has to be
included separately in the library host.  
In NextJS fe. this is done as `import '@pmirau/<package-name>/dist/main.css` in `_app.js`.

Try to develop the library with dynamic css:  
Use css variables to make the library customizable.
Create a `src/styles/_variables.scss` with scss variables, which all components will rely on  
(by `@use '<relative-path-to>/styles/variables';`).

Based on the scss variables, create _CSS custom properties_ in `src/styles/globals.css`, with all
dynamic variables, which should be overridable by the library consumer. (`globals.css` only defines
_CSS custom properties_. Nothing more.)

Finally, import `src/styles/globals.css` in `src/index.ts`, to include them into webpack. Simply
insert `import './styles/globals.css'`.


To override in the library consumer, use following pattern:
1. Import the css-file **once** globally (fe. in `_app.js` in NextJS)
2. Create a separate scss-file in the consumer, only for overriding the library styles:  
   Fe. as `<consumer-root>/src/styles/<library-package>.scss`
3. Override the _CSS custom properties_
